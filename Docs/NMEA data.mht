<H3>Disclaimer</H3>
<P>This site is based on personal research and is believed to be =
accurate but=20
there is no guarantee that any of the information is correct or suitable =
for any=20
purpose. I have been told by the NMEA folks that my information is old =
and out=20
of date.  The current version of NMEA at the time I wrote this is 3.01 =
which is=20
not described here. This site is for historical information and is not =
intended=20
to be used for any official purpose. For official data please contact =
the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.nmea.org/">NMEA</A> web site. Please see the bottom =
of this=20
article for the sources of this data. <A name=3D"intro"></A>
<H3><A name=3D"intro">Introduction</A></H3>
<P>The National Marine Electronics Association (<A=20
href=3D"http://www.nmea.org/">NMEA</A>) has developed a specification =
that defines=20
the interface between various pieces of marine electronic equipment.  =
The=20
standard permits marine electronics to send information to computers and =
to=20
other marine equipment.  A full copy of this standard is available for =
purchase=20
at their web site.  None of the information on this site comes from this =

standard and I do not have a copy. Anyone attempting to design anything =
to this=20
standard should obtain an official copy.=20
<P>GPS receiver communication is defined within this specification. Most =

computer programs that provide real time position information understand =
and=20
expect data to be in NMEA format. This data includes the complete PVT =
(position,=20
velocity, time) solution computed by the GPS receiver. The idea of NMEA =
is to=20
send a line of data called a sentence that is totally self contained and =

independent from other sentences.  There are standard sentences for each =
device=20
category and there is also the ability to define proprietary sentences =
for use=20
by the individual company.  All of the standard sentences have a two =
letter=20
prefix that defines the device that uses that sentence type. (For gps =
receivers=20
the prefix is GP.) which is followed by a three letter sequence that =
defines the=20
sentence contents.  In addition NMEA permits hardware manufactures to =
define=20
their own proprietary sentences for whatever purpose they see fit.  All=20
proprietary sentences begin with the letter P and are followed with 3 =
letters=20
that identifies the manufacturer controlling that sentence.  For example =
a
 Garmin sentence would start with PGRM and Magellan would begin with =
PMGN.=20
<P>Each sentence begins with a '$' and ends with a carriage return/line =
feed=20
sequence and can be no longer than 80 characters of visible text (plus =
the line=20
terminators).  The data is contained within this single line with data =
items=20
separated by commas.  The data itself is just ascii text and may extend =
over=20
multiple sentences in certain specialized instances but is normally =
fully=20
contained in one variable length sentence.  The data may vary in the =
amount of=20
precision contained in the message.  For example time might be indicated =
to
 decimal parts of a second or location may be show with 3 or even 4 =
digits after=20
the decimal point.  Programs that read the data should only use the =
commas to=20
determine the field boundaries and not depend on column positions. There =
is a=20
provision for a checksum at the end of each sentence which may or may =
not be=20
checked by the unit that reads the data. The checksum field consists of =
a '*'=20
and two hex digits representing an 8 bit exclusive OR of all characters =
between,=20
but not including, the '$' and '*'.  A checksum is required on some =
sentences.=20
<P>There have been several changes to the standard but for gps use the =
only ones=20
that are likely to be encountered are 1.5 and 2.0 through 2.3.  These =
just=20
specify some different sentence configurations which may be peculiar to =
the=20
needs of a particular device thus the gps may need to be changed to =
match the=20
devices being interfaced to.  Some gps's provide the ability configure a =
custom=20
set the sentences while other may offer a set of fixed choices.  Many =
gps=20
receivers simply output a fixed set of sentences that cannot be changed =
by the=20
user. The current version of the standard is 3.01. I have no specific
 information on this version, but I am not aware of any GPS products =
that=20
require conformance to this version.  <A name=3D"hardware"></A>
<H3><A name=3D"hardware">Hardware Connection</A></H3>
<P>The hardware interface for GPS units is designed to meet the NMEA
 requirements.  They are also compatible with most computer serial ports =
using=20
RS232 protocols, however strictly speaking the NMEA standard is not =
RS232. They=20
recommend conformance to EIA-422.  The interface speed can be adjusted =
on some=20
models but the NMEA standard is 4800 b/s (bit per second rate) with 8 =
bits of=20
data, no parity, and one stop bit.  All units that support NMEA should =
support=20
this speed. Note that, at a b/s rate of 4800, you can easily send enough =
data to=20
more than fill a full second of time.  For this reason some units only =
send=20
updates every two seconds or may send some data every second while =
reserving=20
other data to be sent less often.  In addition some units may send data =
a couple=20
of seconds old while other units may send data that is collected within =
the=20
second it is sent.  Generally time is sent in some field within each =
second so=20
it is pretty easy to figure out what a particular gps is doing.  Some =
sentences=20
may be sent only during a particular action of the receiver such as =
while
 following a route while other receivers may always send the sentence =
and just=20
null out the values. Other difference will be noted in the specific data =

descriptions defined later in the text.=20
<P>At 4800 b/s you can only send 480 characters in one second. Since an =
NMEA=20
sentence can be as long as 82 characters you can be limited to less than =
6=20
different sentences.  The actual limit is determined by the specific =
sentences=20
used, but this shows that it is easy to overrun the capabilities if you =
want=20
rapid sentence response. NMEA is designed to run as a process in the =
background=20
spitting out sentences which are then captured as needed by the using =
program.=20
Some programs cannot do this and these programs will sample the data =
stream,=20
then use the data for screen display, and then sample the data again.  =
Depending=20
on the time needed to use the data there can easily be a lag of 4 =
seconds in the=20
responsiveness to changed data. This may be fine in some applications =
but=20
totally unacceptable in others. For example a car traveling at 60 mph =
will=20
travel 88 feet in one second. Several second delays could make the  =
entire=20
system seem unresponsive and could cause you to miss your turn.=20
<P>The NMEA standard has been around for many years (1983) and has =
undergone=20
several revisions.  The protocol has changed and the number and types of =

sentences may be different depending on the revision. Most GPS receivers =

understand the standard which is called: 0183 version 2.  This standard =
dictates=20
a transfer rate of 4800 b/s. Some receivers also understand older =
standards. =20
The oldest standard was 0180 followed by 0182 which transferred data at =
1200=20
b/s.  An earlier version of 0183 called version 1.5 is also understood =
by some
 receivers.  Some Garmin units and other brands can be set to 9600 for =
NMEA=20
output or even higher but this is only recommended if you have =
determined that=20
4800 works ok and then you can try to set it faster. Setting it to run =
as fast=20
as you can may improve the responsiveness of the program.=20
<P>In order to use the hardware interface you will need a cable. =
Generally the=20
cable is unique to the hardware model so you will need an cable made=20
specifically for the brand and model of the unit you own. Some of the =
latest=20
computers no longer include a serial port but only a USB port.  Most gps =

receivers will work with Serial to USB adapters and serial ports =
attached via=20
the pcmcia (pc card) adapter. For general NMEA use with a gps receiver =
you will=20
only need two wires in the cable, data out from the gps and ground.  A =
third
 wire, Data in, will be needed if you expect the receiver to accept data =
on this=20
cable such as to upload waypoints or send DGPS data to the receiver.=20
<P>GPS receivers may be used to interface with other NMEA devices such =
as=20
autopilots, fishfinders, or even another gps receivers.  They can also =
listen to=20
Differential Beacon Receivers that can send data using the RTCM SC-104 =
standard.=20
 This data is consistent with the hardware requirements for NMEA input =
data.=20
There are no handshake lines defined for NMEA. <A name=3D"nmea"></A>
<H3><A name=3D"nmea">NMEA sentences</A></H3>
<P>NMEA consists of sentences, the first word of which, called a data =
type,=20
defines the interpretation of the rest of the sentence.  Each Data type =
would=20
have its own unique interpretation and is defined in the NMEA standard.  =
The GGA=20
sentence <A =
href=3D"http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#GGA">(shown=20
below)</A> shows an example that provides essential fix data.  Other =
sentences
 may repeat some of the same information but will also supply new data. =
Whatever=20
device or program that reads the data can watch for the data sentence =
that it is=20
interested in and simply ignore other sentences that is doesn't care =
about.  In=20
the NMEA standard there are no commands to indicate that the gps should =
do=20
something different. Instead each receiver just sends all of the data =
and=20
expects much of it to be ignored.  Some receivers have commands inside =
the unit=20
that can select a subset of all the sentences or, in some cases, even =
the
 individual sentences to send. There is no way to indicate anything back =
to the=20
unit as to whether the sentence is being read correctly or to request a =
re-send=20
of some data you didn't get.  Instead the receiving unit just checks the =

checksum and ignores the data if the checksum is bad figuring the data =
will be=20
sent again sometime later.=20
<P>There are many sentences in the NMEA standard for all kinds of =
devices that=20
may be used in a Marine environment.  Some of the ones that have =
